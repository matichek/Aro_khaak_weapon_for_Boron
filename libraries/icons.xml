    For anyone reading this in the future: I've tried everything to use pre-existing textures,
    but for some arbitrary reason no matter how I've tried, it never worked. So instead we do what every mod
    does and simply copy&paste an existing icon to the correct location, rename it, and wildcard import it.

    I officially hate this. I do not condone this. It feels like a hack. And yet, here we are...

    <add sel="/icons">
		<icon name="upgrade_*" texture="extensions\Aro_khaak_weapon_for_Boron\assets\fx\gui\textures\upgrades\*.tga" height="256" width="256"/>
